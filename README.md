Description
-----------

A model exploring modal growth in baroclinic development. This code calculates the eigenvalue s (baroclinic wave frequency as a complex number) and eigenvector x (vertical profile of QG streamfunction and omega vertical velocity as complex numbers) from a matrix problem Ax=sBx based on the potential vorticity and omega equations for a set of predefined zonal wavenumbers. The wave structure of the eigenvectors is found for two dimensions (x,p) by using a wave solution exp(ikx).


Model is inspired by and extended from the analytical model by:
